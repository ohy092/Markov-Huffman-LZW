# Markov-Huffman-LZW
An assignment for the course INF144 Information theory.

oblig.pdf is the task specification.
Mandatory1.pdf is my report.
Mandatory1.java is my code submission.
folktale.txt is a source file that can be used for input. This is not the actual source file that was handed out for this assignment, but a copy I got from Google and then formatted to contain all lowercase, no punctuation, and no line shifts.

No changes have been made since my initial submission, apart from changing external and local file paths, as they may not be available.
